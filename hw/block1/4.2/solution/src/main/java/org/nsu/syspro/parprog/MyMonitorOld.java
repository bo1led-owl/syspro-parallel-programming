     * IllegalMonitorStateException if the current thread is not the owner of the
     * monitor. See the notify method for a description of the ways in which a
     * thread can become the owner of a monitor lock.
     * 
     * This method causes the current thread (referred to here as T) to place itself
     * in the wait set for this monitor and then to
     * relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object. Note that only
     * the locks on this monitor are relinquished; any
     * other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked
     * while the thread waits.
     * 
     * Thread T then becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies
     * dormant until one of the following occurs:
     * 
     * - Some other thread invokes the notify method for this monitor and thread T
     * happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened.
     * - Some other thread invokes the notifyAll method for this monitor.
     * - Thread T is awakened spuriously. (See below.)
     * 
     * The thread T is then removed from the wait set for this monitor and
     * re-enabled for thread scheduling. It competes in the usual
     * manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object; once it
     * has regained control of the object, all its
     * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante -
     * that is, to the situation as of the time that the
     * wait method was invoked. Thread T then returns from the invocation of the
     * wait method. Thus, on return from the wait method,
     * the synchronization state of the object and of thread T is exactly as it was
     * when the wait method was invoked.
     * 
     * A thread can wake up without being notified, a so-called spurious wakeup.
     * While this will rarely occur in practice, applications
     * must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused
     * the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if
     * the condition is not satisfied.
     * 
     * For more information on this topic, see section 14.2, "Condition Queues," in
     * Brian Goetz and others'
     * Java Concurrency in Practice (Addison-Wesley, 2006) or Item 69 in Joshua
     * Bloch's Effective Java, Second Edition (Addison-Wesley, 2008).
